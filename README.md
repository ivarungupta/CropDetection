# CropDetection

Welcome to CropDetection, an innovative project by Team KhetiMitr for detecting plant diseases using imagery and advanced machine learning techniques.

## Overview

CropDetection aims to assist in identifying plant diseases efficiently by analyzing images of crop leaves. Simply upload an image, and our system will process it to detect any signs of diseases.

## Features

- **Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

## Dataset

LINK : [Click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset).

## How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
2. **Analysis**: The system processes the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
3. **Results**: View the results and recommendations for further action.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
